creator_notes: "
Can't enjoy an organic role-playing experience without the thrill of meta-gaming?<br>
Worried you'll develop genuine feelings or accidentally exercise thought-provoking introspection if numbers and chance aren't artificially injected into every experience?<br>
Why endure some meaningless simulacrum of our equally meaningless reality when you can let the dice take control?<br>
Crunchatize Me could be the stage for you! Or not. It's something for somebody, though!<br>
<br>
**What it does:**<br>
Adding this stage to a chat will cause your every input to be distilled into a skill check against one of eight attributes. 
Two six-sided dice will be rolled, with difficulty and skill modifiers, to determine whether you succeed or fail.
<br><br>
Unlike most chats, where you don't want the bot to speak or act for your character, 
this stage requires you to forfeit agency over the details of your actions; 
the bot is instructed to take your skill check result and paraphrase your choices as it narrates the results.
<br><br>
The Stage vaguely follows Powered by the Apocalypse system rules, where 2d6 are rolled and modifiers added or subtracted to arrive at 
one of three degrees of success. Failures grant experience, which slowly leads to a level up--increasing the stat you attempted to use 
most during that level.
<br><br>
There are eight stats, and they are all a bit nebulous and overlapping:<br>
 * Might - Physical strength and endurance<br>
 * Grace - Agility and composure<br>
 * Skill - Craft and deftness<br>
 * Brains - Knowledge and judgment<br>
 * Wits - Instinct and awareness<br>
 * Charm - Allure and influence<br>
 * Heart - Determination and empathy<br>
 * Luck - Karma and fortunate<br>
<br>
You can view console output to see the classification results that the stage is using to arrive at its skill/difficulty assessments.
<br><br>
**What's next:**<br>
I think I'll add some basic health tracking, but obviously the biggest missing element is some form of character creation, 
as currently, everyone starts with no bonuses. Maybe I'll add that, or maybe I'll move on to other stages, 
but I thought this was interesting enough to release as-is.
