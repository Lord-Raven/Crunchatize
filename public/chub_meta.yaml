tagline: "Turn any chat into a basic CYOA RPG."

creator_notes: "***Warning: This stage does not currently persist the user's pre- or post-history prompt to the LLM for its action prompts;
if you rely on a jailbreak in these settings, this stage will NOT honor it. As a result, _please_ do not include this stage directly on 
character cards at this time.***

The stage builds assembles some history and other details for its prompts, but has no way to get at the user's jailbreak yet. I 
hope this will be resolvable with the next wave of Stage features.

**What it does:**<br>
Adding this stage to a chat will cause every response to end with a number of (usually) stat-based choices. 
You will forfeit agency over the details as you choose general directions, rolling the dice to see whether you succeed or fail.
<br><br>
The Stage vaguely follows Apocalypse system rules, where two D6 are rolled and a modifier added or subtracted from the result to arrive at 
one of three degrees of success. Failures will grant experience which slowly leads to a level up--increasing the stat you attempted to use 
most during that level.
